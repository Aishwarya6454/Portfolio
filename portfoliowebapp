# Portfolio Builder App

## Overview
The **Portfolio Builder App** is a web application that allows users to create and manage personalized portfolios. Users can log in with their Google account, add sections to their portfolio, upload a profile picture, and export their portfolio as a PDF. The app uses Firebase for authentication, Firestore for data storage, and Firebase Storage for image storage.

## Features
- **User Authentication**: Users can sign in with their Google account.
- **Portfolio Management**: Add, edit, and display different sections of the portfolio.
- **Profile Picture Upload**: Users can upload a profile picture that is stored in Firebase Storage.
- **Export Portfolio as PDF**: Users can export their portfolio as a PDF document.
- **Responsive UI**: Built with React and styled using custom CSS for a clean and intuitive user interface.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Backend**: Firebase (Firestore for database, Firebase Authentication for user authentication, Firebase Storage for storing images)
- **PDF Export**: jsPDF
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (or custom CSS as per your project)

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
Before setting up the application, ensure that Node.js and npm are installed on your system, as they are necessary for managing dependencies and running the application locally.

### Steps to Run the Application Locally

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. **Install Dependencies**  
   Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies.

3. **Set Up Firebase**  
   - Go to the Firebase Console and create a new Firebase project.
   - Set up Firebase Authentication (enable Google sign-in method).
   - Set up Firebase Firestore and Firebase Storage.
   - Retrieve the Firebase configuration object and update the `firebaseConfig.js` file in the project with your credentials.

4. **Start the Application**  
   Once everything is set up, run the app to view it locally in your browser.

### Firebase Configuration (`firebaseConfig.js`)

The `firebaseConfig.js` file contains the Firebase credentials required to connect the app with Firebase services. Make sure to update it with your own Firebase project credentials.

```javascript
import { initializeApp } from "firebase/app";
import { getAuth } from "firebase/auth";
import { getFirestore } from "firebase/firestore";
import { getStorage } from "firebase/storage";

const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
  authDomain: "YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN",
  projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
  storageBucket: "YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET",
  messagingSenderId: "YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID",
  appId: "YOUR_APP_ID"
};

const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
export const auth = getAuth(app);
export const db = getFirestore(app);
export const storage = getStorage(app);

Key Components of the Application
Authentication
The app uses Firebase Authentication to allow users to sign in using their Google account. This is handled by the signInWithPopup method from Firebase.

Portfolio Management
Users can create, read, and modify portfolio sections. Each section has a title and content that can be edited by the user. Portfolio data is stored in Firebase Firestore.

Image Upload
Users can upload a profile image, which is stored in Firebase Storage. Once uploaded, the image URL is retrieved and displayed on the user’s profile.

PDF Export
The app uses the jsPDF library to allow users to export their portfolio as a PDF. The sections of the portfolio are rendered into a PDF format when the "Export as PDF" button is clicked.

How to Contribute

Troubleshooting
If you face issues with the application, try the following:

Ensure that your Firebase project is set up correctly, and the Firebase credentials are accurately updated in the firebaseConfig.js file.
Double-check the authentication settings in the Firebase Console to ensure that Google authentication is enabled.
Make sure the required Firebase services (Firestore and Storage) are configured properly.
Check the browser console for any error messages and refer to the documentation for solutions.
